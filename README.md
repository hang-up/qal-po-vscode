## Extension Settings
> This section is a WIP. Among other things, we need to enable dynamic page object folders.

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something

## Known Issues

- No Go To Definition
- No Rich preview
